# Challenge Prompt

## Log Event Processing Problem

* Imagine there is a sheer quantity of log event data is staggering into your program, and the data is streaming in from
  many sources. So, there is no possible way to hold it all events in memory. The log events cannot be guaranteed to
  arrive in chronological order inside of any 300 second window.

* Design a system that uses minimum processing time and memory, but returns log events in orderly fashion.
